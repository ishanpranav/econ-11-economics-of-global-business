## Question 1

> Suppose an economy produces aluminum, microchips and computers. The aluminum
> industry produces $320,000 in revenue, spends $60,000 on microchips, $55,000
> on computers, pays workers $95,000. The microchip industry produces $220,000
> in revenue, spends $60,000 on aluminum, $35,000 on computers and pays workers
> $90,000. The computer industry produces $190,000 in revenue, spends $60,000 on
> microchips, $55,000 on aluminum and pays workers $60,000. There is no
> government. Calculate GDP using the production and income approaches.

| Agent | Revenue ($ thousand) | Material cost ($ thousand) | Value added ($ thousand) | Labor cost ($ thousand) | Profit ($ thousand) |
|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| Aluminum industry | $320$ | $60+55=115$ | $205$ | $95$ | $110$ |
| Microchip industry | $220$ | $60+35=95$ | $125$ | $90$ | $35$ |
| Computer industry | $190$ | $60+55=115$ | $75$ | $60$ | $15$ |
| __Total__ | $730$ | $325$ | $405$ | $245$ | $160$ |

__Production approach.__

We can measure gross domestic product by computing the "value added" at each
step of production.

The value added by an industry is given by its revenue minus its material costs.
Summing the "value added" over all industries gives $405,000.

Thus, the gross domestic product via the production approach is $405,000.

__Income approach.__

We can instead measure gross domestic product by computing the total payments to
labor and capital.

An industry's payments to labor are given by its labor cost. The sum over all
industries is $245,000.

In this economy, profits account for the remainder of the income. An industry's
profits are given by its revenue minus its material and labor costs. Summing the
profits over all industries gives $160,000.

Together, the sum of income from labor and income from profits is $405,000.
Thus, the gross domestic product via the income approach is also $405,000.
