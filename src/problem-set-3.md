## Question 1: U.S. and trade

As aides to Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) in the U.S. Congress, we are
charged with analyzing U.S. trade deficits and their potential connection with
the budget deficit of the U.S. government.

We will use exports of goods and services
([EXPGS](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/EXPGS)) and imports of goods and
services ([IMPGS](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IMPGS)), both from the U.S.
Bureau of Economic Analysis. We will also use the federal surplus or deficit
([FYFSD](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FYFSD)) from the U.S. Office of
Management and Budget. All are available from FRED, the Federal Reserve Bank of
St. Louis.

### Question 1 Part A

__Selected values of exports (EXPGS), imports (IMPGS), net exports, and U.S. budget surplus (FYFSD).__

| in billions of $ | Exports | Imports | Net exports or (imports) | U.S. budget surplus or (deficit) 
|-----------------|---------:|---------:|----------:|-----------:|
| 1970            |   60.873 |   57.888 |    2.985  |    (2.842) |
| 2000            | 1113.177 | 1524.520 | (411.343) |   236.241  |
| 2024            | 3218.600 | 4149.659 | (931.059) | (1832.816) |
| 2024 minus 1970 | 3157.727 | 4091.771 | (934.044) | (1829.974) |

### Question 1 Part B

We will use the nominal gross domestic product
([GDP](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDP)) from the U.S. Bureau of Economic
Analysis and available from FRED, the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.

__U.S. exports and imports as a percentage of nominal GDP.__

__Interpretation.__

* Over the past 50 years, the growth in imports' share of output has outpaced
  that of exports. Thus, the U.S. has shifted from a net exporter to a net
  importer.
* The U.S. trade balance has become a deficit, and the deficit's share of output
  has increased over the last half-century.
* Both imports' share and exports' share of output have experienced an
  increasing trend over the last 50 years. This trend indicates that U.S.
  foreign trade has become more open as trade accounts for a greater portion of
  the domestic economy.
  * One explanation is the globalization of the world economy and the
    industrialization of emerging countries during this period.
  * Since 1970, the U.S. has been shifting into a service-oriented economy, and
    thus may rely more heavily on imported goods. This coincides with increases
    in education, technology, and the cost of labor.
  * The Cold War saw increased American interventionism, the liberalization of
    foreign economies, and the emergence of the U.S. as the sole world
    superpower.
  * The hegemony of the U.S. dollar and other American institutions still drives
    U.S. trade policy.
* Since spending is greater than output, the U.S. is a more open economy. This
  implies that investments have outpaced savings.
* The U.S. is a net borrower.

### Question 1 Part C

__U.S. net exports or (imports) and budget surplus or (deficit) as a percentage of nominal GDP.__

__Correlations.__

Since the beginning of the time series in 1947, net exports and budget surplus
had a 73.38-percent correlation. As a share of nominal GDP, their correlation
was 0.4964.

Since 1970, net exports and budget surplus had a 68.95-percent correlation. As
a share of nominal GDP, their correlation was 0.2123.

### Question 1 Part D

__Theoretical relationship.__

Theoretically, an increase in government spending leads to an increase in the
fiscal deficit. A fiscal deficit implies negative public savings.

_Cateris paribus_, national savings decrease. This suggests an increase in the
trade deficit.

The theoretical relationship is a pair of "twin deficits" whereby the budget
deficit and trade deficit comove, so their shares of nominal GDP should be
strongly correlated.

__Empirical relationship.__

Empirically, however, the relationship between the budget and trade deficits is
weaker than predicted by economic theory. Between 1970 and 2024, the correlation
between their shares of nominal GDP was only about 0.21.

Based on the chart above, there have been periods in recent memory when the
budget and trade deficits have move inversely, which contradicts theory.

We conclude that there must be confounding factors missing from our model which
further explain the relationship.

__Counterexamples.__

* During the 1990s, the U.S. trade deficit was expanding; however, the budget
  deficit was shrinking.
  * The Clinton administration made aggressive reforms to U.S. fiscal policy to
    reduce the budget deficit, resulting in a budget surplus for the first time
    in recent memory.
  * The U.S. dollar was relatively strong during this period, so imports
    outpaced exports, and the trade deficit expanded.
  * The 1990s saw strong robust economic growth. Consumption, including
    consumption of imports, increased, thus increasing the trade deficit.
  * This period was marked by heightened globalization, the expansion of
    international trade, and milestones like the North American Free Trade
    Agreement. These contributed to the rising trade deficit, despite the fiscal
    deficit falling.
* During the 2008 financial crisis, the U.S. trade deficit was shrinking;
  however, the budget deficit increased rapidly.
  * The financial crisis caused the deterioration of the U.S. (and later,
    global) economy, lower consumer confidence, and decreased consumption. As a
    result, imports fell as a share of GDP, and the trade deficit decreased.
  * Oil prices fell dramatically during the 2008 financial crisis. Since oil and
    its derivatives are major U.S. imports, imports fell as a share of GDP.
  * The Obama administration stabilized the economy by implementing major
    bailout and stimulus programs such as the Troubled Assset Relief Program and
    the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008. These vastly expanded the fiscal deficit.
* During the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, the U.S. trade deficit expanded
  slightly; meanwhile, the budget deficit exploded to a record, nearing 15
  percent of the U.S. GDP.
  * Imported medical supplies, equipment, and consumer products increased
    imports relative to exports. At the same time, the pandemic disrupted global
    supply chains and created frictions for both imports and exports. The net
    effect was a slight increase in the trade deficit.
  * The Trump administration expanded government spending to massive and
    unprecedented levels. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act
    addressed the economic fallout of COVID-19 with stimulus, loans, and
    spending. The fiscal deficit exploded to its highest level as a share of GDP
    in recent memory.
