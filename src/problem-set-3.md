## Question 1: U.S. and trade

As aides to Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) in the U.S. Congress, we are
charged with analyzing U.S. trade deficits and their potential connection with
the budget deficit of the U.S. government.

We will use exports of goods and services
([EXPGS](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/EXPGS)) and imports of goods and
services ([IMPGS](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IMPGS)), both from the U.S.
Bureau of Economic Analysis. We will also use the federal surplus or deficit
([FYFSD](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FYFSD)) from the U.S. Office of
Management and Budget. All are available from FRED, the Federal Reserve Bank of
St. Louis.

### Question 1 Part A

__Selected values of exports (EXPGS), imports (IMPGS), net exports, and U.S. budget surplus (FYFSD).__

| in billions of $ | Exports | Imports | Net exports or (imports) | U.S. budget surplus or (deficit) 
|-----------------|---------:|---------:|----------:|-----------:|
| 1970            |   60.873 |   57.888 |    2.985  |    (2.842) |
| 2000            | 1113.177 | 1524.520 | (411.343) |   236.241  |
| 2024            | 3218.600 | 4149.659 | (931.059) | (1832.816) |
| 2024 minus 1970 | 3157.727 | 4091.771 | (934.044) | (1829.974) |

### Question 1 Part B

__U.S. exports and imports as a percentage of nominal gross domestic product (GDP).__

We will use the nominal gross domestic product
([GDP](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDP)) from the U.S. Bureau of Economic
Analysis and available from FRED, the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.
