## Question 1: U.S. and trade

As aides to Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) in the U.S. Congress, we are
charged with analyzing U.S. trade deficits and their potential connection with
the budget deficit of the U.S. government.

We will use exports of goods and services
([EXPGS](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/EXPGS)) and imports of goods and
services ([IMPGS](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IMPGS)), both from the U.S.
Bureau of Economic Analysis. We will also use the federal surplus or deficit
([FYFSD](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FYFSD)) from the U.S. Office of
Management and Budget. All are available from FRED, the Federal Reserve Bank of
St. Louis.

### Question 1 Part A

__Selected values of exports (EXPGS), imports (IMPGS), net exports, and U.S. budget surplus (FYFSD).__

| in billions of $ | Exports | Imports | Net exports or (imports) | U.S. budget surplus or (deficit) 
|-----------------|---------:|---------:|----------:|-----------:|
| 1970            |   60.873 |   57.888 |    2.985  |    (2.842) |
| 2000            | 1113.177 | 1524.520 | (411.343) |   236.241  |
| 2024            | 3218.600 | 4149.659 | (931.059) | (1832.816) |
| 2024 minus 1970 | 3157.727 | 4091.771 | (934.044) | (1829.974) |

### Question 1 Part B

We will use the nominal gross domestic product
([GDP](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDP)) from the U.S. Bureau of Economic
Analysis and available from FRED, the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.

__U.S. exports and imports as a percentage of nominal GDP.__

__Interpretation.__

* Over the past 50 years, the growth in imports' share of output has outpaced
  that of exports. Thus, the U.S. has shifted from a net exporter to a net
  importer.
* The U.S. trade balance has become a deficit, and the deficit's share of output
  has increased over the last half-century.
* Both imports' share and exports' share of output have experienced an
  increasing trend over the last 50 years. This trend indicates that U.S.
  foreign trade has become more open as trade accounts for a greater portion of
  the domestic economy.
  * One explanation is the globalization of the world economy and the
    industrialization of emerging countries during this period.
  * Since 1970, the U.S. has been shifting into a service-oriented economy, and
    thus may rely more heavily on imported goods. This coincides with increases
    in education, technology, and the cost of labor.
  * The Cold War saw increased American interventionism, the liberalization of
    foreign economies, and the emergence of the U.S. as the sole world
    superpower.
  * The hegemony of the U.S. dollar and other American institutions still drives
    U.S. trade policy.

### Question 1 Part C

__U.S. net exports or (imports) and budget surplus or (deficit) as a percentage of nominal GDP.__
