## Question 1: The Taylor Rule

We will use real gross domestic product
([GDPC1](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDPC1)) and personal consumption
expenditures, chain-type price index less food and energy
([JCXFE](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/JCXFE)) from the U.S. Bureau of
Economic Analysis. We will also use real potential gross domestic product
([GDPPOT](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDPPOT)) from the U.S.
Congressional Budget Office. Finally, we will use the federal funds effective
rate ([FEDFUNDS](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDFUNDS))
from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. All are available
from FRED, the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.

### Question 1 Part A

__The Taylor rule and the federal funds (1971–2025).__

![The Taylor rule and the federal funds rate over time.](https://github.com/ishanpranav/econ-11-economics-of-global-business/blob/master/images/problem-set-4-1.png?raw=true "The Taylor rule and the federal funds rate over time")

__Model.__

We use the Taylor rule to estimate the nominal interest rate over time,
comparing it to the actual federal funds rate:

$$i_t=r^{\ast}+\pi_t+a_1(\pi_t-\pi^{\ast})+a_2(y_t-y_t^{\ast}).$$

* Let $i_t$ represent the short-term nominal inflation rate in period $t$, as
  estimated by the Taylor rule;
* let $r^{\ast}*$ be the long-term real interest rate (we assume
  $r^{\ast}=2\%$);
* let $\pi_t$ be the inflation rate in period $t$;
* let $a_1$ be the sensitivity of the interest rate to inflation (we assume
  $a_1=0.5$);
* let $\pi^{\ast}$ be the target inflation rate (we assume $\pi^{\ast}=2\%$);
* let $a_2$ be the sensitivity of the interest rate to output (we assume
  $a_2=0.5$);
* let $y_t$ be the real output (logarithmic) in period $t$;
* and let $y_t^{\ast}$ be the potential real output (logarithmic).

 __Interpretation.__

* During the 1970s, the federal funds rate was higher than estimated by the
  Taylor rule.
* During the 2008 financial crisis, the Taylor rule suggested a marginally
  negative nominal interest rate. However, the Federal Reserve rejected this
  policy and asserted that interest rates should be floored at zero. Instead,
  the Federal Reserve opted for quantitative easing.
* During the 2020 pandemic, the Taylor rule suggested a deeply negative interest
  rate. Again, the Federal Reserve kept interest rates at zero, while the
  government pursued other approaches to stimulate output, such as the CARES
  Act.
* Between 2021 and 2024, the Taylor rule suggested a rapid and major increase in
  the interest rate. Although the Federal Reserve acted quickly, it fell short
  of the Taylor rule's extreme suggestions to combat inflation and react to high
  growth in output.

### Question 1 Part B

> Discuss what the impact was of the Federal Reserve's policy in for much of the
> 1970s? Be sure to provide empirical evidence to support your argument. Why
> might the Fed have chosen this policy?

During the 1970s, the American economy experienced major inflationary pressures,
one of which was the Middle East oil crisis. Over this period, the federal funds
rate was higher than the interest rate estimated by the Taylor rule.

This suggests that, despite already-high nominal interest rates, the Federal
Reserve was aggressive in its tightening approach. The Federal Reserve likely
preferred lower long-term price levels over short-term relief.

### Question 1 Part C

> Fed deviations from a Taylor rule were smaller and less persistent after 1985.
> What was the impact on output and inflation? Be sure to provide empirical
> evidence to support your argument.

After 1985, Fed deviations from the Taylor rule are smaller and less persistent.
As a result, output and inflation were balanced. Inflation generally declined
since the 1970s, while output generally increased since the 1970s. Since then,
there has been no period as inflationary, even including the 2020 pandemic.

### Question 1 Part D

> In the mid-2000s, what was the stance of monetary policy relative to the
> Taylor Rule? Speculate on the potential consequences of this policy and how it
> relates to the run up in housing prices in the early 2000s and then the
> subsequent crash.

In the early-to-mid-2000s, the federal funds rate was generally lower than
suggested by the Taylor rule. This means that monetary policy was too lenient.
It is likely that as the economy was growing, the Federal Reserve preferred the
low interest rates but neglected the inflationary pressure. One consequence was
that housing prices increased and formed a major speculative bubble, a product
of cheap capital and accessible debt financing. This bubble was responsible for
the 2008 financial crisis.

### Question 1 Part E

> After 2008, could the Federal Reserve implement what the Taylor rule
> prescribed? Why or why not? What can the Fed do to stimulate aggregate demand
> if the Taylor rule rate is below zero?

After 2008, the Federal Reserve *could have* implemented the marginally negative
interest rate suggested by the Taylor rule. However, if that rate were
significantly negative, it would be completely unfeasible since investors would
prefer to keep their savings in physical possession rather then lending them to
banks at a negative rate of return.

To stimulate aggregate demand when the Taylor rule rate is below zero, the Fed
can engage in quantitative easing, whereby the Fed purchases long-term
securities (such as long-term U.S. Treasury bonds and agency mortgage-backed
securities) to increase the money supply and lower long-term interest rates.
This encourages borrowing and investment and stimulates aggregate demand.

### Question 1 Part F

> How does the Federal Reserve's policy in 2020 compare to what the Taylor rule
> predicts? What about from 2021 to 2024? Discuss how these predictions relate
> to Fed’s policies in these years. Do you agree with the Fed's most recent
> decision (on March 2025) regarding interest rates based on the most recent
> available data?

In 2020, the Taylor rule predicts a deeply negative interest rate. However, the
Federal Reserve floored rates at zero and pursued quantitative easing instead.

Between 2021 and 2024, the Taylor rule predicts a major increase in the interest
rate over a short period of time. Although the Fed acted quickly, it did not
undertake the drastic reaction suggested by the Taylor rule.

Based on the most recent available data, the Taylor rule still predicts an
interest rate higher than the current federal funds rate. This supports the
Fed's decision to keep rates "higher for longer" in response to inflation and
output growth.

Arguably, however, the U.S. economy currently faces pressures to trade and
output. If these obstacles persist, the Federal Reserve may need to lower rates
quickly in the impending recession.
