## Question 1: The Taylor Rule

> As a junior bond trader at Goldman Sachs, you have been asked by your boss to
> explain the Taylor Rule and how it can be a helpful guide to how the Federal
> Reserve sets monetary policy. Write a short report summarizing your findings.
> Your report should contain the following pieces of information:

We will use real gross domestic product
([GDPC1](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDPC1)) and personal consumption
expenditures, chain-type price index less food and energy
([JCXFE](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/JCXFE)) from the U.S. Bureau of
Economic Analysis. We will also use real potential gross domestic product
([GDPPOT](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDPPOT)) from the U.S.
Congressional Budget Office. Finally, we will use the federal funds effective
rate ([FEDFUNDS](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDFUNDS))
from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. All are available
from FRED, the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.
